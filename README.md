# ParseSwiftiOSTemplate
This is a template for a Swift Single View Application configured with Parse and all frameworks to start with.

To initialize your project sign up for Parse.com, and get your applicationID and clientKey here: https://parse.com/apps/quickstart#parse_data/mobile/ios/native/new 

With that information, go to the AppDelegate.swift file and add the applicationID and clientKey in the didFinishLaunchingwithOptions block.

There is a test in ViewController.swift to make sure your app is now hooked up, feel free to remove it before or after testing.
